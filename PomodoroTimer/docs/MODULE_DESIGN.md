# Module Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and architecture of the Pomodoro Timer application. It describes the main components, their responsibilities, interactions, and how they fit into the overall architecture.

## Components

### Flask Backend

- **Purpose**: Serves as the web server, handles routes, and provides API endpoints for interacting with the timer.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Serve HTML, CSS, and JS files to the client's browser.
  - Provide API endpoints for the frontend to start, pause, reset the timer, and update settings.
  - Maintain the session state and handle timing logic.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript Frontend

- **Purpose**: Provide a user interface for the Pomodoro Timer allowing users to start, pause, reset, and configure timer settings.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Display the timer and allow user interactions via buttons and sliders.
  - Use JavaScript to manage timer countdown, UI updates, and session transitions.
  - Save settings using browser's local storage.

## Module Interactions

1. **Frontend Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the UI to start/pause/reset the timer.
   - UI sends HTTP requests to backend APIs based on user actions.
   - Frontend listens for responses to update the UI state.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Receives requests from the frontend and processes timer operations.
   - Sends responses back to the frontend to synchronize UI state.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **Backend**:
  - Test the API endpoints for correct behavior, status codes, and data integrity.
- **Frontend**:
  - Test JavaScript functions for timer logic, DOM manipulation, and settings management.

### Manual Testing

- Ensure the application functions correctly on various browsers.
- Verify UI responsiveness and interactions on different devices.
- Test notifications and local storage functionality.

## Future Considerations

- Implement integration tests for end-to-end flow.
- Optimize performance for slower devices.
- Add features such as custom themes and user authentication.
